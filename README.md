##Shared Element Transition in Jetpack Compose
This project showcases the implementation of shared element transitions using Jetpack Compose's ExperimentalSharedTransitionApi. It provides smooth, visually appealing animations for transitioning between list items and detailed views, enhancing user experience.

##Features
 Seamless Shared Element Transitions: Implement smooth transitions between list and detail screens. Images and text elements animate seamlessly, creating a cohesive and engaging visual experience.

 Dynamic Navigation: Utilizes the Jetpack Navigation Component to handle transitions between screens. Navigate between list items and their detailed views with shared element animations.

 Responsive Content Handling: Handles dynamic content on both list and detail screens with animations that adapt to changes in the displayed content.

##Key Components
##ListScreen
 Displays a list of items featuring images and text. Each item is clickable, leading to a detailed view with shared element animations. The transitions ensure a smooth visual connection between list items and their detailed counterparts.

##DetailScreen
 Shows detailed information about a selected item. This screen features animated transitions for images and text that align with their counterparts from the list screen, providing a fluid and consistent visual experience.

##Navigation Setup
  Configured with NavHost and NavController for managing navigation between ListScreen and DetailScreen. This setup supports passing arguments to dynamically populate content and ensures smooth transitions.

##Code Overview
  SharedTransitionScope: Contains composables like DetailScreen and ListScreen that use sharedElement to animate elements across screens, implementing smooth transitions for images and text.

  MainActivity: Sets up the Scaffold and NavHost, managing screen navigation and transitions. Applies shared element transitions to enhance user interaction between list and detail screens.

  Greeting Composable: A simple composable used in the preview to demonstrate text rendering.
